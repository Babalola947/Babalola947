<h2> <center> MY ACHIEVEMENT </center> </h2>

<body>

<p>

       I am Babalola Oluwapelumi Aaron by name,  A student of Kwara State University, Malete, 
department of Library and Information Science.
</p>

      <p>  Achievement is associated with the targeted goals or aims in life. When we define our action in relation to something like a goal a task is created. A task when fulfilled is called an achievement earned.
 The struggle in life is the sum total of our achievements, success, failures, mistakes.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, my achievement, my success or my accomplishment is the name given to my fulfilled goals. The failure, in turns, is the names given to my mistakes, my setbacks, and my loss.
</p>

<p>
Every person in life h
as some achievements, accomplishments, rewards and successes earned. At the same time mistakes, failures and setbacks as well. My achievements, my successes and my accomplishments are the one that make 
me happy and proud. Whereas, my mistakes, my failures and setbacks make me strong and bold.
</p>

<p>
There are various kinds of achievements one may have. There are some examples of achievements like personal achievements, academic achievements, sports achievements etc.
</p>

<p>
There are various roles in which one achieves something. Taking myself as an example it would be like my achievements as a teacher, my accomplishments as student in school, college or in personal life.
</p>

<p>
 Firstly, Being in kwara State University, Malete(KWASU the WORLD CLASS UNIVERSITY).
</p>

<p>
Secondly, It is also an opportunity for Maintaining peace  and healthy life as well as a career. 
</p>

<p>
 Thirdly, Exercising leadership, authority and influence
</p>

<p>
<i>“That my seniority as an academic has enabled me to work with others to facilitate steps towards significant culture change within the University has heartened me greatly.”</i>
    <p>
Whilst there was clear frustration about obstacles in the way of securing leadership roles, when they got to positions of influence they wanted to do something constructive with their authority. Having a positive
 effect on and engagement with others
</p>

<p>
Linked to the idea of exercising effective leadership was a strong interest in enabling the progression of others. People described the vicarious thrill that came with helping team members, or junior colleagues, 
to establish themselves as successes. Offering support could take the form of mentoring, helping people to identify their strengths, creating a good working environment, inspiring passion in a subject, enabling 
someone to cope with a setback or simply being a great teacher. It was seen as a privilege to be in a position to develop others and as such was not something to be taken lightly.
</p>

<em> “I encourage people to develop themselves and not to be held back by feelings that, first, it’s not their place to develop themselves beyond their prescribed role and second, that it’s something beyond them.”</em>

<p>
 My greatest achievement in academic achievement is that I have successfully got admission in my desire career. My parents are proud of me. They always wanted me to be a great Librarian. It is my passion to serve my 
country, and i have been a diligent and dedicated student of my school
</p>

<p>i am grateful to my parent, teachers and evryone that particiate in all my goals and achievements. THANKS
